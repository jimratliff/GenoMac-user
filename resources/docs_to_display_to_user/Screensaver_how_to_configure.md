# How to select the Matrix Screensaver as your screensaver

## Find the already-opened Wallpaper panel from System Settings
- Locate the Wallpaper panel from System Settings that has already been opened for you.
- In the right-hand side, in the topmost subpanel, you’ll see:
  - on the left side (of this right-side panel), a picture of your current wallpaper
    (probably one of the macOS defaults).
  - On the right side (of this right-side panel):
    - The name of the current wallpaper (e.g., “Tahoe Day”)
    - “Show on all Spaces” with a toggle
    - A line with two buttons: (a) “Screen Saver…” and (b) “Clock Appearance”

## Choose Matrix as the custom screen saver
- Click on “Screen Saver…”
- A modal dialog will open:
Start Screen Saver…
Use Screen Saver (radio buttons)
Automatic
Custom
Select Custom
The pane will expand vertically downward to show a variety of screen savers to choose from
Go to the bottom of that pane, under the “Other” heading and click “Show All”
Go to the end of the selection of screen savers and select “Matrix”
Return to the top, you’ll see “Matrix” under the two rows (“Start Screen Saver…” and “Use Screen Saver”)
Click the “Options…” button (this doesn’t seem to be working)
Click “Done”
