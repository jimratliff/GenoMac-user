# How to log in to 1Password.app
Launch 1Password and/or make it active.

Log into your 1Password account. The best way to do this is:
- When you launch the desktop 1Password app for the first time, it will prominently display a "Sign in" button.
  Click that. It will display a sign-in dialog box, including a QR code you can use to make the sign-in process
  quicker.
- Get your iPhone.
  - Launch 1Password on iPhone
  - From the 1Password logo in the upper-left corner of the 1Password app on iPhone, select “Scan QR Code…”
  - Follow the instructions

Then return to the terminal and acknowledge that you have successfully authenticated 1Password.app on the Mac.
