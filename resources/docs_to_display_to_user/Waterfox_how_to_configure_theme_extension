# How to install and configure the “Activist - Balanced” theme for the Waterfox web browser

## Context: GenoMac-user can’t currently install the “Activist - Balanced” theme extension for you
Although, GenoMac-user *can* install many other extensions it’s tried to install, for some reason GenoMac-user
can’t successfully install the “Activist - Balanced” extension. So you’ll need to manually install it.

## Make Waterfox active and install from the “Activist - Balanced” theme extension web page
- ❑ Make Waterfox active
  - The script will already have opened the Waterfox application for you.
- ❑ Visit [“Activist – Balanced” theme page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/activist-balanced_).
- ❑ Click on “Install Theme”

## Return to the terminal
Now return to the terminal and acknowledge you have completed the installation of the “Activist - Balanced”
theme for Waterfox.
