# How to configure Keyboard Maestro

## Context
- Keyboard Maestro doesn’t demand that a new user immediately register the app. There is an initial trial period.
- The following will already have been done by the time you read this:
  - Your settings for Keyboard Maestro will have been programmatically specified
  - Keyboard Maestro has been informed where your custom Keyboard Maestro macros are, and it has synced them.

## Launch Keyboard Maestro Editor
- Make Keyboard Maestro Editor the active app. (The Hypervisor should have launched it for you already.)
## Approve access to Dropbox
- A dialog box pops up: “‘Keyboard Maestro.app’ wants to access files managed by ‘Dropbox’.”
Click “Allow”
## Other dialog boxes you may see
- A dialog may popup: “Allow ‘Keyboard Maestro Engine’ to find devices on local networks?”
  - “This will allow the app to discover, connect to, and collect data from devices on your networks.”
  - ❑ Click “Allow”
- At some point, the editor might popup a dialog box: “We would love to contact you with some helpful tips on how to get the most out of Keyboard Maestro…”
    - ❑ Click “No Thanks”
- There may be other warnings about permissions that Keyboard Maestro needs
   
## Register Keyboard Maestro
You can register Keyboard Maestro (which requires an email address and serial number) by using an already-synced custom macro!

- ❑ Make Keyboard Maestro Editor active.
- ❑ Click on the Keyboard Macro menubar status icon, and choose “GenoMac Bootstrap » Register Keyboard Maestro”
- This will choose the menu item: “Keyboard Maestro” » “Register Keyboard Maestro…”, and then populate the email-address and serial-number fields with the credentials under which my Keyboard Maestro is registered.
  - Note that these credentials do *not* exist in this repo, but rather are stored in my securely privately synced macro set.
- ❑ Click on the “Register” button to confirm the assignments and complete the registration process.
  
## Return to terminal and acknowledge
- [ ] Type `done` to acknowledge that you’ve completed these manual steps.
