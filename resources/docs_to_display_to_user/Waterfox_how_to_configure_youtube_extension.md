#### “Controls”
Notes:
- Each control is represented by an icon that I can’t replicate here. Instead, I’ll refer to
  each icon by a position and text that you’d see if you hover over the icon.
- The row, and position within a row, of each of the below control may change. You can hover over
  each icon, at which time a “(i)” will appear in its upper-righthand corner. Hovering over the “(i)” will show a
  tooltip telling you what the function of that control is.

- Row 1 of controls:
  - Item 1: Loop mode (“Click or right-click to toggle the loop mode”)
    - ❑ Turn OFF ❌ this item
  - Item 3: Volume booster (“Click to toggle the volume booster”)
