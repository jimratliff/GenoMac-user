# How to configure Alfred

## Launch Alfred
- Make Alfred the active app. (The Hypervisor should have launched Alfred for you already.)
- You will see a “Welcome to Alfred 5” dialog box
  - “There are just a few things we need to do before we get started”
    - “Configure your Powerpack”
      - “You will be able to optionally enter your Powerpack details for uninterrupted Alfred productivity.”
    - “Backup previous Alfred Preferences”
      - “If you are migrating from Alfred 2 or above, this step will allow you to backup your prefereces before migrating.”
    - “Migrate Preferences”
      - “This step will allow you to import your preferences, or if syncing, use your already synced preferences”
    - “Set up macOS Permissions”
      - “Alfred requires certain macOS permissions to automate your Mac. This step will get you started.”
    - There are three buttons: “Quit,” “Skip Setup,” and “Begin Setup…”
