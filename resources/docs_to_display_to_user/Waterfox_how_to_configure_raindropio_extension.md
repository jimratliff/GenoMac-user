# How to install and configure the Raindrop.io extension for the Waterfox web browser

## Context: GenoMac-user can’t currently install the Raindrop.io extension for you
Although, GenoMac-user *can* install every other extension it’s tried to install, for some reason GenoMac-user
can’t successfully install the Raindrop.io extension. So you’ll need to manually install it.

- ❑ Click on “Add to Firefox” (even though you’re adding to *Waterfox* 🤪)
    - ❑ Pin 📌 ? ✅
 
## Sign in to your Raindrop.io account
- ❑ Click the cloud icon in the toolbar that corresponds to the Raindrop.io extension
