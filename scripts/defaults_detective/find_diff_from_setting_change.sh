function find_diff_from_setting_change(){

# Saves pre-change `defaults read` output, pausing for user to make the desired change(s) in
# preferences.
# After user indicates they’re finished, saves post-change `defaults read` output.
# Then displays `diff` of the two files.
#
# Usage: 
# - Run script
# - Make the change(s) in preferences for which you’re searching for the corresponding 
#   `defaults write` command(s)
# - Hit any key to signal that you’ve completed making the change(s)
# - The script will output *two* sets of diffs: (a) global for the user, i.e., for all hosts and
#   (b) limited to `-currentHost`
# - Observe produced diffs, which will show you the *key(s)* that have changed
#   - Note: Some changes in key will be inconsequential/irrelevant. You’ll need judgement to 
#     know to ignore them.
# - The observed diff won’t tell you the *domain* of the changed key(s). For that use either:
#     `defaults find *key*`
#     `defaults -currentHost find *key*`
# - The observed diff won’t tell the *type* of the changed domain/key pairs. For that use either:
#     `defaults read-type *domain* *key*` or
#     `defaults -currentHost read-type *domain* *key*`

# Relies on the environment variable GENOMAC_USER_LOCAL_DEFAULTS_DETECTIVE_RESULTS having been set
# in assign_environment_variables.sh. This is the directory in which the results of the 
# `defaults read` of each branch of the before-and-after experiment will be stored.
# (Most of the time you won’t need to access directly the contents of that directory, and this 
# directory can be deleted at the send of a detective session. This is why the directory is not
# hidden.)
